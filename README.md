# Facebook Message analyzer

This project is a small idea to create Facebook message analyzer from json files, which could be easily downloaded from your Facebook profile settings.

In its' current state, the app does parse json file, create special objects for each and every element of chat communication, as well as can crawl through multiple directories.

## Usage:

Currently the app is in backend-only state. To use some of the functions of the project, read the docstrings included to the files/functions/objects, if you'd like to do some funky stuff with them!

## TODO:

  - add search functions
  - add counters for specific reacts
  - fix character encoding
  - add UI/GUI
